            <p1>This is my product photography. This is what I have been doing the longest, it is what I am best at, and it is what I enjoy most doing. Anytime I acquire something new and interesting, I take pictures of it, to try and capture what makes it so unique.

                This can mean the craftsmanship that went into a knife blade, or the design work that went into a solid brass wallet, or any million other things that I see in something someone else put real work into.</p1>
